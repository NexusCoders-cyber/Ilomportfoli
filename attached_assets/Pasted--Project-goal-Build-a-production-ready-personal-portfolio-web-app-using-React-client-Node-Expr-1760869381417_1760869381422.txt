> Project goal: Build a production-ready personal portfolio web app using React (client) + Node/Express (backend) + MongoDB. Host/develop in Replit. The site should be fast, mobile-first, accessible, SEO friendly, and visually modern. Include:

Primary features

1. Public site with pages: Home (hero + CTA), About (bio + skills + timeline), Projects (cards & filters), Amazing Bot page (features, demo GIF/video, GitHub repo link), Blog / Updates (dynamic feed), Contact (form).


2. Admin portal (password-protected) where I can manually create/update/delete:

Projects (title, description, stack, images, repo link, live link)

Updates / Blog posts (title, body, tags, date, publish toggle)

Bot info (feature list, embed demo link/video, GitHub repo link)



3. Authentication for admin: simple, secure login (email + password) with JWT tokens and password hashing. Admin credentials can be set with environment variables or created through a setup script.


4. MongoDB for storage (I will supply MONGODB_URI). Use Mongoose. All data models should be well-typed and validated.


5. REST API (secure endpoints for admin actions). Public endpoints for fetching projects, updates, bot info.


6. File upload for project images (S3-compatible or Replit storage; fallback to Base64 if required).


7. SEO: meta titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags for each project and blog post. Sitemap and robots.txt.


8. Analytics: integrate an easy-to-configure analytics (e.g., Plausible or Google Analytics) but keep configurable by env.


9. Responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Add subtle animations with Framer Motion.


10. Accessibility: WCAG basics ‚Äî keyboard nav, alt text, semantic HTML, color contrast.


11. Deploy-ready: a start script for production, instructions for Replit deployment and GitHub repo link displayed in the portfolio.



Design & UX

Clean, minimal, yet bold hero with short tagline and "See My Bot" CTA.

Card grid for projects, each card shows tech badges, short description, GitHub icon linking to repo.

Admin dashboard: table/list of items, create/edit modal forms, delete confirmation, simple WYSIWYG for updates (rich text).

Dark + light theme toggle persisted in localStorage.

Microinteractions: hover elevation on project cards, subtle page transitions, and in-dashboard success toasts.


Tech stack & libraries

Frontend: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Router, SWR or React Query for data fetching, React Hook Form for forms, react-markdown for blog content preview.

Backend: Node.js + Express, Mongoose, bcrypt for hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWT, multer (or equivalent) for uploads.

DB: MongoDB (use provided MONGODB_URI).

Dev & Deployment: Replit + GitHub integration. Use environment secrets for MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD (initial).


Data models (Mongoose)

AdminUser { email, passwordHash, createdAt }

Project { title, slug, description, stack: [String], images: [String], githubUrl, liveUrl, createdAt, featured:Boolean }

Update { title, slug, contentMarkdown, tags:[String], published:Boolean, publishedAt, createdAt }

BotInfo { name, tagline, description, demoUrl, githubRepo, screenshots: [String], features: [String] }

ContactMessage { name, email, message, createdAt, status }


API endpoints (examples)

POST /api/auth/login ‚Äî returns JWT

GET /api/projects ‚Äî public

GET /api/projects/:slug ‚Äî public

POST /api/projects ‚Äî admin (auth)

PUT /api/projects/:id ‚Äî admin

DELETE /api/projects/:id ‚Äî admin

GET /api/updates ‚Äî public

POST /api/updates ‚Äî admin

GET /api/bot ‚Äî public

PUT /api/bot ‚Äî admin

POST /api/contact ‚Äî public (saves message and optionally emails me via SMTP or third-party)


Security

Protect admin endpoints with JWT middleware.

Validate and sanitize inputs server-side.

Store secrets as Replit secrets / environment variables.


Deliverables

1. Full Replit project containing client/ and server/ directories.


2. README with setup & deployment steps, a short demo GIF, instructions to set env vars (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD), and how to update admin credentials.


3. Example .env.example.


4. A minimal seed script to create the initial admin user if not present (reads ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD).


5. Optional: a one-click Replit run button or instructions to import the project into Replit.



Styling guidance

Use a modern, geometric sans-serif for headings and an easy-reading body font.

Palette: 1 accent color (e.g., electric teal) + muted neutrals. Provide CSS tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.

Keep hero height to viewport, with an animated call-to-action (e.g., glowing button).


Extras

Add a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù meta and JSON-LD schema for site owner.

Add preview images for each project when shared on social media.


Important: create code that‚Äôs easy to extend. Keep components small and well-commented. Prioritize clarity and production readiness.

Final instruction: Generate the full project, wire the front-end to the API using fetch/SWR, add admin forms, and include a README.md with step-by-step instructions to connect my provided MongoDB URI and deploy on Replit.

üõ† Implementation checklist (for your reference)

[ ] Create Replit project with client/ (React Vite) and server/ (Express).

[ ] Add .replit + run commands: cd server && node index.js & cd client && npm run dev (adjust for Replit).

[ ] Add env variables in Replit secrets: MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, ANALYTICS_ID.

[ ] Implement data models and REST API routes.

[ ] Create React pages/components and admin dashboard.

[ ] Add deploy instructions & seed admin script.

[ ] Test admin flow, project CRUD, upload, and contact form.

[ ] Add SEO & analytics.

[ ] Final polish: accessibility, responsive, image optimization.

üé® Quick design notes (for the developer/agent)

Use Tailwind utility classes for layout.

Provide components: Hero, ProjectsGrid, ProjectCard, BotShowcase, UpdatesFeed, AdminDashboard.

Use react-markdown to render blog/update markdown safely.

For project images, show a modal gallery on click.
